This is our ESPRG present to Allan, the best manager that Microsoft office in Prague has ever seen. 

This project serves as a proof of Allan's bestness - he managed to create such a great team that they not just bought some random goodbye booze for him but gathered to create this hardware present - online, in the times of coronavirus. Ain't this amazing?
